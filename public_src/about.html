  <h1>Visualization of HDB Resale Market</h1>

  <p>
    With Singapore rolling out its
    <a href="http://www.smartnation-forbes.com/" target="_parent">Smart Nation Vision</a>
    and the recent launch of IDA's new <a href="https://data.gov.sg/" target="_parent">open data portal</a>,
    budding web developers <a href="https://github.com/caalberts" target="_parent">Albert Salim</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/yongjun21" target="_parent">Yong Jun</a>
    embarked on building our first data visualization project.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two of us took a public dataset, the
    <a href="https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices" target="_parent">HDB Resale Flat Prices</a>,
    and made use of the latest web technologies to present data in the most intuitive and
    accessible manner for the public to better understand trends in the HDB resale market.
    We design our app for the user to explore data from 2 perspectives: time and space.
    Data is presented in the form of:
  </p>

  <ol type="i">
    <li>A time series chart showing historical price trends, and</li>
    <li>A heat map showing the hottest locations for HDB resale in Singapore.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    We hope the marriage of data and web will make the normally dry subject more interesting
    to the average man. And hopefully, public can become more aware of the availability
    of these open data and how they can be tapped to make life better for everyone.
    This is our contribution as web developers to the Smart Nation Movement.

      in the selcted town for the month and flat type.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Average</h3>
  <p>
    Markers represent average transaction price in that month while the error bars represent
    the uncertainty around this average based on the number of data points available.
    To calculate this uncertainty, we used 95% t-confidence interval.
  </p>

  <h3>Min, Max & Median</h3>
  <p>
    Markers represent median transaction price while error bars connect to the
    highest and lowest transacted prices.
